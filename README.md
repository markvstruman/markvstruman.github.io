My name is Victor Struman, a W26 EECS494 student, and this is my portfolio showcasing our team's Legend of Zelda project.

I was in charge of the item logic. This includes but is not limited to the sword, boomerang, the sword beam, and bomb.

I was also in charge of the core level progression, ensuring that as Link moves between rooms enemies that were not killed respawn, and some events such as unlocking/closing doors behind Link and item drops trigger on enemy death.

Finally, I developed the core enemy movement logic that uses a mixture of random selection and raycasting. This was extended further when I implemented the Wallmaster and the Goriya enemies.

This project was developed using the Unity engine, utilizing C# as the project's language.
