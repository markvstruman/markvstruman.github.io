# Overview
My name is Victor Struman, a W26 EECS494 student, and this is my game design portfolio!

# Echoes
This is a game created as part of a rapid prototyping project for EECS494.

Echoes explores the horror genre, risk-versus-reward, and how to explore information gathering in a stylistic way with it's echolocation mechanic.

As a night guard for Leo's Coney Island, you are tasked with powering off the generators before going home for the night; however, as you turn off each generator, you lose access to the light they provide, and the safety of their noise drowning out your own.

# Legend of Zelda
This project was made in collaboration with Jingzhou Zhou and Trent Mullin, and was the first project of EECS494. This is a close-to-faithful recreation of Legend of Zelda NES's Eagle Dungeon.

I was in charge of the item logic. This includes but is not limited to the sword, boomerang, the sword beam, and bomb.

I was also in charge of the core level progression, ensuring that as Link moves between rooms enemies that were not killed respawn, and some events such as unlocking/closing doors behind Link and item drops trigger on enemy death.

Finally, I developed the core enemy movement logic that uses a mixture of random selection and raycasting. This was extended further when I implemented the Wallmaster and the Goriya enemies.

This project was developed using the Unity engine, utilizing C# as the project's language.
